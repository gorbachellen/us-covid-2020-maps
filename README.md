# US COVID Cases in 2020
## Author: Ellen Gorbach

## Introduction
2020 marked the beginning of a difficult period in recent history. The arrival of COVID-19 and its subsequent rapid spread through our population was a turning point in our lives. Over the course of 2020, the constant waves of COVID-19 meant frequent upheavals as everyone learned how to live during the pandemic. The maps below show which counties were hit the hardest by COVID in the span of 2020.
